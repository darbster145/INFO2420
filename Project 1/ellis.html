	<h3>Questions</h3>
	<br>
	<ol>
		<h4>
			<li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Answer: The site feels professional but also personal, like it’s trying to connect with you but also
			is trying to move you emotionally</p>
		<hr>

		<h4>
			<li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and
				text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Answer: There’s a menu at the top, and you click around to get where you need to go. No
			weird layouts or confusion.</p>
		<hr>

		<h4>
			<li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Answer: It’s easy to follow and makes sense. You can find what you’re looking for without digging
			around.</p>
		<hr>

		<h4>
			<li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Answer: The design is clean and easy on the eyes. It only has 2 pictures on the main page so it is
			clean. It uses just enough images to keep it interesting
			but not overwhelming.</p>
		<hr>

		<h4>
			<li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Answer: It loaded pretty fast for me, a second at the most</p>
		<hr>

		<h4>
			<li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it
				enhance or detract from the site?</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Answer: The text is readable, and the background doesn’t distract from it. Nothing fancy, but it
			works.</p>
		<hr>

		<h4>
			<li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?
			</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Answer: There’s a nice little menu at the top that’s easy to use. You won’t get lost.</p>
		<hr>

		<h4>
			<li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Answer: The colors and design stay the same across all the pages, which makes it feel polished.</p>
		<hr>

		<h4>
			<li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Answer: It works great on smaller screens too. You don’t have to scroll sideways or zoom in. All of
			the elements scale down really well.</p>
		<hr>

		<h4>
			<li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Answer: It stands out because it feels personal, and the content is relatable and easy to connect
			with. You can tell thought went into it.</p>
